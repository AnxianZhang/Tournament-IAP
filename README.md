# Tournament-Project
Frist year in college : first project

There is 3 folders:
  - in-out: It contains 5 directories, in which there are a "in file" and "out file".
            The inG07Sp files are those that the application will handle. 
            Then after the processing, the output data must be the same as the 
            output file (outG07Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4 or Sp5) that corresponding 
            to the selected input file (inG07Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4 or Sp5).

  - original-version: This version is the one that we made (I and Florent Wang) 
                      at the beginning of the first year of college. Which, we
                      did not finish the project, hence the different files.
                      
  - remade-version: In this one the project is fully finished. And in the file there
                    is the 5 sprints.
