# Tournament (initiation to development)

## (original-version) Mark: 12/20

### **Context**: Make an application which allows a tournament to be processed. Which is divided into 5 sprints.
  - Sprint 1: Save and show a tournament
  - Sprint 2: Show all matchs of a players
  - Sprint 3: Show all players of a tourment with their scores, there will be sorted by their names.
  - Sprint 4 & 5: displays the last 4 tournaments that have been registered, showing the names of 
                  the players and their scores, they will be sorted by their scores, then 
                  by their names (only if they have the same amount of scores).

### **Repository content:**
  - in-out: It contains 5 directories, in which there are a "in file" and "out file".
            The inG07Sp files are those that the application will handle. 
            Then after the processing, the output data must be the same as the 
            output file (outG07Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4 or Sp5) that corresponding 
            to the selected input file (inG07Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4 or Sp5).

  - original-version: This version is the one that we made (with Florent Wang) 
                      at the beginning of the first year of college (2021-10 to 2021-12). 
                      Which, we did not finish the project, hence the different files.
                      
  - remade-version: In this one the project is fully finished (redone on 2022-06-06 to 2022-06-20).
